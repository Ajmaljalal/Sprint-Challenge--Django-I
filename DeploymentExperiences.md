# Deployment Process

- I started by importing the dependecies that were required. Installing and importing them were an easy proccess. 

- I then followed all the instructions, and brought some changes to the files.

- Once I set all the configurations localy I then created a heroku app and pushed my local version online. Here is the link to my app ```https://ajmal-djorg.herokuapp.com/``` 

- I did run the migrate command and worked. 

- Now my app is online but due to a bug it is not working. I could not find the bug though.
