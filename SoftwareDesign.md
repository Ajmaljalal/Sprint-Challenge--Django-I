## My favorite design pattern
 
 # Module Design Pattern
 - This is my favorite design patter that I learned about it this and I already used it almost from the beginning of the program. 
 - In JavaScript, modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code

 # Anti Pattern expereince
 - I once run iton anti-pattern problem. In object-oriented programming is a 'God object' or a very very huge object which performs a lot of functions which would be better separated into different objects. In my personal project I created only one object for the whole application. Then I realized that it is very hard to read and maintain. I finally used the module design pattern to get rid of the problem.
